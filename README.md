# Lab1-Numbers

# Lab 1 

This C# console application serves as a practical demonstration of essential mathematical operations executed on an array of numerical values. 

## Intro 
this program perfoms the steps
1. The program prompts the user to enter four numbers, which are then used to populate an array. 
2.  It proceeds to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the array and presents the resulting value to the user.
3. Next, the program prompts the user to choose a random number from the array.
4. It multiplies this randomly selected number by the previously calculated sum and displays the product to the user.
5. the program requests the user to input another number, which will be used to divide the aforementioned product.
6. It performs the division operation and calculates the quotient. 
7.  Finally, the program presents the quotient to the user as the result.
	
## Usage 
1. Please execute the program by running it.
2. When prompted, kindly provide four numbers as input.
3.Choose any number from the provided options randomly.
4.Choose any number from the provided options randomly.
5.Upon completion, the program will present the calculated sum, product, and quotient for your reference.

## Error handling 

1. If the sum of the numbers is less than 20, an error message will be displayed to notify the user.
2. If an invalid index is chosen while selecting a random number from the array, an error message will be shown to inform the user.
3. If the user enters zero as the divisor, an error message will be presented to alert the user about the invalid input.
